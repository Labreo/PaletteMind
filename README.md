# 🎨 Semantic Color Palette Generator

The **Semantic Color Palette Generator** is a single-page web tool that generates structured and meaningful color palettes from abstract design themes using AI. Built with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript, this tool bridges the gap between language and color theory by turning concepts like _"optimistic futurism"_ or _"vintage rebellion"_ into 5-color palettes, complete with role assignments and a design justification.

## 🌟 Features

- ✨ **AI-generated palettes** based on abstract themes
- 🎯 **Structured color roles**: Primary, Secondary, Accent, Text, Background
- 🧠 **Color theory explanation** for each palette (generated by AI)
- 🎨 **Live swatch rendering** using DOM manipulation
- 📋 **Click-to-copy** individual hex codes
- 💡 Simple, fast, and elegant interface – no frameworks
- 🧑‍🎨 Has light/dark mode toggle

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The user enters an abstract theme like `"cyberpunk nostalgia"` or `"serene wilderness"`.
2. The app sends a prompt to an AI (like OpenAI's GPT or a mock) asking it to return:
   - A JSON object with 5 colors (each with `role`, `name`, `hex`)
   - A paragraph of justification rooted in design theory
3. The UI dynamically renders the swatches, hex values, and explanation using JavaScript.

## 🧠 Example Prompt (to the AI)

```txt
You are an expert designer and color theorist. I will give you an abstract theme. You will generate a harmonious and functional 5-color palette. You must return ONLY a JSON object with this structure: {
  "palette": [
    {"role": "Primary", "hex": "#...", "name": "..."},
    {"role": "Secondary", ...}
  ],
  "justification": "A paragraph explaining why this palette fits the theme based on color psychology and theory."
}
The theme is: "optimistic futurism"
```

## 🧑‍🎨 Why This Project?

Designers often struggle to translate **mood boards or abstract ideas** into functional color systems. This tool solves that by combining the power of **AI + color theory + interactive UI** — making it a useful creative assistant for designers, developers, and artists.
